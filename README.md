# Financial Analysis using Power BI & DAX
## Problem Description 
This project presents a comprehensive Credit Card Financial Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI, leveraging powerful DAX functions for deriving advanced financial insights. The goal is to analyze credit card usage patterns, customer behavior, risk levels, and overall financial health for a banking institution.

## Project Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

To evaluate key financial metrics including transaction trends, customer behavior, credit usage, and risk.

To build dynamic KPIs such as:

 - Running totals

- Moving averages

- MoM and WoW growth

- Delinquency rate

- Churn indicators

- Credit risk scoring

To assist financial institutions in making data-driven decisions to:

- Improve customer retention

- Identify high-risk clients

- Optimize credit policies

- Enhance profitability


# Key Metrics and DAX Calculations
## Metric / KPI	
- Running Total - Tracks cumulative credit card transactions over time
- 4-Week Moving Average - Smooths credit limit trends for each client
- MoM% and WoW% Growth - Measures growth rates in transaction amounts
- Customer Acquisition Cost(CAC) Ratio - Evaluates efficiency of customer acquisition
- Yearly Avg Utilization Ratio - Measures credit usage behavior of clients annually
- Interest Earned % of Revolving Balance - Insights into revenue from revolving credit
- Top 5 Clients by Transaction Amount - Highlights the most valuable customers
- Avg Utilization Ratio > 80% - Flags high credit usage clients
- Customer Churn Indicator (6 Months) - Identifies inactive or potentially lost clients
- Delinquency Rate - % of clients with overdue credit card accounts
- Credit Risk Score - Composite score based on utilization, revolving balance, delinquency
- Income vs Credit Limit Correlation - Analyzes financial capacity of clients
- Avg Satisfaction by Card Category - Understands customer experience per product
- Loan Approval vs Credit Limit - Assesses how credit limit impacts loan approval chances
- High-Risk Clients Flag - Detects financially stressed clients for proactive actions

## Tools & Techniques

- Power BI	: Data visualization and DAX calculation
- DAX (Power BI) : Data Analysis Expressions


## Key Insights

- 20% of clients are identified with high credit utilization (>80%) â€” indicating financial strain.

- Top 5 clients contribute to a significant percentage of total transactions â€” potential for upselling or personalized offers.

- 15% churn rate was observed in clients inactive for 6 months â€” opportunity to design re-engagement campaigns.

- Strong correlation between income and credit limit â€” can guide future credit approval strategies.

- Clients with approved personal loans had a notably higher average credit limit â€” suggesting possible approval thresholds.

##  Future Improvements

- Build an interactive dashboard using **Power BI**.
- Add predictive modeling using Python (with Power BI Python visuals)

- Integrate real-time transaction data via Power BI Service and APIs

- Extend analysis to include cross-product behavior (e.g., loans, savings)

- Build client segmentation using clustering techniques

- Incorporate automated alert systems for credit risk escalation.
